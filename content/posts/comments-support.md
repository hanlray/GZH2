Anki is a great tool for remembering things.  But the process of creating/generating notes/cards is cumbersome, especially when you have lots of notes/cards to be created.  I have been using Anki to learn a wide variety of knowledge for several years, and since I'm a software developer I'm able to write code to facilitate the process of custom creation of notes/cards. This kind of expertise helps me a lot and I guess other people could also benefit from this. That's why I'm offering this kind of service:

* Custom note types
  Image/audio fields are supported
* Custom card layouts
  You define the order of fields and rendering
* Batch creation of notes/cards
  Scrape note information from a variety of source, for instance, dictionaries/web/files, to generate a collection of notes so that you can import into your anki app to learn.
